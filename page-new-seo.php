                <p style="font-size:100%;text-align:justify;font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif;font-weight: 300;">Karma Cây Tre is numbered amongst the luxury resorts Vietnam can offer you.

                We have 22 chic villas with breathtaking views for you to choose from: the pool view, the river view and the gardens view. These are perfect for romantic getaways or family quality time.<br/><br/>
                On-site, we can offer you delicious cuisine in the Banana restaurant and a swim-up bar right by the pool. However, the proximity of the Cua Dai Beach is one of the reasons your stay at Karma will be more than worthwhile.<br/><br/>
                The beach is covered in white sand and turquoise, clear water. You can relax and enjoy the beautiful view of the Cham Islands, while palm trees protect you from the sun. Swimming, reading or just enjoying a cocktail, the possibilities for resting your mind, body and soul are various.<br/><br/>
                “The Management and Sales Team staff are extremely accommodating and helpful with any issue that may arise. The only way to explain this would be that you are treated like family by all. The Hotel has inclusive free events/meal nights which bring together guests making the whole experience a more relaxed friendly atmosphere. Free breakfast/bicycles are included. It is actually pleasant to have a resort that gives back to its guests.” Gazzabus from Perth, Australia, on TripAdvisor</p>

This is why from all the resorts in Vietnam, best resorts have more pleased customers:<br/><br/>
              <span style="text-align:center;">“Everyone at the resort was helpful and very friendly. Whether it was arranging a cooking class or going on a trip to the market, they went out of their way to please. The room was clean and bright; the grounds were well kept, and the pool was beautiful. A freshly prepared buffet breakfast every morning was a real treat and a nice way to start the day. We especially liked the 16 h tradition of the gonging in of the ice man and the start of Happy Hour. They work hard to deliver an awesome experience for the guests - and it shows!” Frederic C from Dundas, Canada, on TripAdvisor</span><br/><br/>
